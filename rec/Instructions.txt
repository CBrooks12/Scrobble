Welcome to Scrobble!
Where trivium and strategy come together in an epic battle of wits!

You will find everything you need to know about how to play here!

Goal:

Get the most points with the most creative (and longest) words.

Instructions:

Players take turns placing one tile at a time anywhere on the board.
When placing tiles, players take turns trying to build words or blocking their
opponent's words.

To test or claim a word, the player must click on each tile used in the 
creation of that word and then press the End Turn button. 
If it is a valid word points will be awarded based off of both the difficulty and 
the length of the word formed.

The game will continue until one of two things happens. Either there are no more spaces
for tiles to be played on or there are no more tiles remaining in the draw pile.

The player with the most points wins.
